        <h1>Types Of Photos</h1>
        <p>By learning and practicing this three important different types of photography , you can build
            a strong foundation for your photography career.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="phototype-col">
                <h3>Portrait Photography</h3>
                <p>One of the most common photography styles, portrait photography, or portraiture, aims to capture the
                    personality and mood of an individual or group. Images may be candid or posed, full body or
                    close-ups. Either way, the subject’s face and eyes are typically in focus. Lighting and backdrop
                    help to convey tone and emotion</p>
            </div>
            <div class="phototype-col">
                <h3>Fashion Photographyy</h3>
                <p>Fashion photography showcases and glamorizes fashion clothing, shoes, and accessories to make them
                    more desirable to consumers. It is commonly published in magazines and online. People may choose
                    this niche over different types of photography because of the opportunity to be highly creative in
                    making photographs eye-catching and appealing. Fashion photographers take a lot of full body shots
                    and work in an array of locations, from fashion shows to studios with full lighting setups to city
                    streets and open fields</p>
            </div>
            <div class="phototype-col">
                <h3> Architectural Photography</h3>
                <p>Both the interior and exterior design of buildings and structures are the subject of architectural
                    photography. From warehouses to city bridges to old country barns, this genre encompasses diverse
                    structures. Often, the photograph showcases the structure’s most aesthetically pleasing parts, such
                    as a particular beam or archway. Interesting materials and colors may also be emphasized. Lighting
                    can be challenging in architectural photography and, for exteriors, photographers must know how to
                    work with natural light.</p>
